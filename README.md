# GoFetchMedia
Go Fetch Media from Photo Api services 

This app will allow you to fetch your images from API services such as Instagram, Flickr, and Pinterest. 
(Just the Instagram is working for now).
It's also possible to get the number of "Like" of the images and  the "Comments" posted on images.
